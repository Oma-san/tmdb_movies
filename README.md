### Introduction

This analysis is on TMDB movies dataset, the columns in this data include: id, imdb_id, popularity, budget, revenue, original_title, cast, homepage, director, tagline, keywords, overview, runtime, genres, production_companies, release_date, vote_count, vote_average, release_year, budget_adj and revenue adj. The id, imdb_id, tagline, keywords and overview are not so important, while popularity, budget, revenue, cast, director, runtime, genres and vote average are important.

### Questions for Analysis
 1. What factors influence popularity and the vote average of the movies?

 2. What is the correlation between budget and revenue i.e Does a higher budget lead to a higher revenue?

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, I found out that Budget, Revenue and Vote count are the most influential factors affecting popularity and while newer movies are more popular and have more vote counts on average, they have less vote averages.

I also found that vote average seems to be uninfluenced by the other numeric values except for popularity, runtime and vote count.

Based on the analysis, there is a strong positive relationship between the budget and revenue. (So it pays to invest a lot in a movie, because this may lead to a lot of revenue).
